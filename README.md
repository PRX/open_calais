# OpenCalais

Ruby gem to access the [OpenCalais API](http://www.opencalais.com/documentation/calais-web-service-api/api-invocation/rest), using the new-ish REST API, and JSON responses.
It uses [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday) to abstract HTTP library (defaults to use excon because ot is excellent), and multi_json to abstract JSON parsing.

It returns a parsed version of the response, but the response also contains the raw response (converted from json to hashes/arrays/string/etc).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'open_calais'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install open_calais

## Usage

OpenCalais has one main method, `enrich`, and so does the gem:

```ruby
require 'open_calais'

# you can configure for all calls
OpenCalais.configure do |c|
  c.api_key = "this is a test key"
end

# or you can configure for a single call
open_calais = OpenCalais::Client.new(:api_key=>'an api key')

# it returns a OpenCalais::Response instance
response = open_calais.enrich('Ruby on Rails is a fantastic web framework. It uses MVC, and the Ruby programming language invented by Matz in Japan.')

# which has the 'raw' response
response.raw

# and has been parsed a bit to get :language, :topics, :tags, :entities, :relations, :locations
# as lists of hashes
response.tags.each{|t| puts t[:name] }
```
